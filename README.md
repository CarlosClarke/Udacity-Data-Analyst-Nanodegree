# Udacity - Data Analyst Nanodegree
Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program outline and project files.

In January 2023, I commenced the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program, and 
this repository encompasses the project files and notes associated with it.

## Program Outline
**Intro to Data Analysis**    
Project: Investigate a Dataset
* **Anaconda**  
This topic covers a brief overview of the Anaconda environment, widely recognized as one of the most popular environments for Python-based data analysis.
* **Jupyter Notebooks**  
Jupyter Notebooks serve as an excellent resource for initiating Python code writing. While in production scenarios, code is commonly crafted in scripts, notebooks prove invaluable for sharing insights and showcasing data visualizations.
* **The Data Analysis Process**  
Explore the data analysis process and enhance your skills in investigating diverse datasets by utilizing Python and its robust packages tailored for data analysis.
* **Programming Workflow for Data Analysis**  
Expand your knowledge by delving into an alternative workflow for Python analysis. This includes exploring IPython's command line interface, composing scripts in text editors, and executing scripts in the terminal.

**Practical Statistics**  
Project: Analyze A/B Test Results
* **Descriptive Statistics**  
This topic covers insights into data types, measures of central tendency, and the fundamentals of statistical notation. The following measures are examined: variability, distribution shape, and identifying outliers in the context of quantitative data.
* **Probability**  
Acquire the fundamentals of understanding probability.
* **Binomial Distribution**  
Exploring Binomial Distribution, a widely utilized probability distribution.
* **Conditional Probability**  
Not all events operate independently. Probability rules govern dependent events, as well.
* **Bayes Rule**  
Acquire knowledge of one of the paramount principles in statistics - Bayes' Rule.
* **Normal Distribution Theory**  
Understand the mathematical principles involved in transitioning from a simple coin-flip scenario to a normal distribution.
* **Sampling Distributions and the Central Limit Theorem**  
Delve into the fundamentals of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing by gaining a comprehensive understanding of the underlying concept: sampling distributions.
* **Confidence Intervals**  
Discover the application of sampling distributions and bootstrapping techniques to construct a confidence interval for any parameter of interest.
* **Hypothesis Testing**  
Acquire the essential skills for both constructing and analyzing results in hypothesis testing.
* **Regression**  
Leverage Python to implement linear regression models and gain proficiency in interpreting the outcomes of these models.
* **Multiple Linear Regression**  
Acquire the knowledge and skills to implement multiple linear regression models in Python. Gain proficiency in interpreting the results and assessing the goodness of fit for your model.
* **Logistic Regression**  
Develop expertise in utilizing logistic regression models in Python. Gain the ability to interpret the results and assess the goodness of fit for your logistic regression model.
 
**Data Modeling**  
Project: Data Modeling with Postgres
* **Intro to Data Modeling**  
This topic covers the fundamental distinctions between relational and non-relational databases. The lesson will elucidate how each database type aligns with the varied requirements of data consumers.
* **Relational Data Models**  
This topic provides insight into the significance of data modeling, exploring the advantages and limitations of relational databases, and active engagement in creating schemas and tables within the Postgres environment.
