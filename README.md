# Udacity - Data Analyst Nanodegree
Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program outline and project files.

In January 2023, I commenced the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program, and 
this repository encompasses the project files and notes associated with it.

## Program Outline
Intro to Data Analysis  
Project: Investigate a Dataset
* **Anaconda**  
This topic covers a brief overview of the Anaconda environment, widely recognized as one of the most popular environments for Python-based data analysis.
* **Jupyter Notebooks**  
Jupyter Notebooks serve as an excellent resource for initiating Python code writing. While in production scenarios, code is commonly crafted in scripts, notebooks prove invaluable for sharing insights and showcasing data visualizations.
* **The Data Analysis Process**  
Explore the data analysis process and enhance your skills in investigating diverse datasets by utilizing Python and its robust packages tailored for data analysis.
* **Programming Workflow for Data Analysis**  
Expand your knowledge by delving into an alternative workflow for Python analysis. This includes exploring IPython's command line interface, composing scripts in text editors, and executing scripts in the terminal.
* **Investigate a Dataset**
