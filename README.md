Understand the mathematical principles involved in transitioning from a simple coin-flip scenario to a normal distribution.
* **Sampling Distributions and the Central Limit Theorem**  
Delve into the fundamentals of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing by gaining a comprehensive understanding of the underlying concept: sampling distributions.
* **Confidence Intervals**  
Discover the application of sampling distributions and bootstrapping techniques to construct a confidence interval for any parameter of interest.
* **Hypothesis Testing**  
Acquire the essential skills for both constructing and analyzing results in hypothesis testing.
* **Regression**  
Leverage Python to implement linear regression models and gain proficiency in interpreting the outcomes of these models.
* **Multiple Linear Regression**  
Acquire the knowledge and skills to implement multiple linear regression models in Python. Gain proficiency in interpreting the results and assessing the goodness of fit for your model.
* **Logistic Regression**  
Develop expertise in utilizing logistic regression models in Python. Gain the ability to interpret the results and assess the goodness of fit for your logistic regression model.
 
**Data Modeling**  
Project: Data Modeling with Postgres
* **Intro to Data Modeling**  
This topic covers the fundamental distinctions between relational and non-relational databases. The lesson will elucidate how each database type aligns with the varied requirements of data consumers.
* **Relational Data Models**  
This topic provides insight into the significance of data modeling, exploring the advantages and limitations of relational databases, and active engagement in creating schemas and tables within the Postgres environment.

**Data Wrangling**  
Project: Wrangle and Analyze Data
* **Intro to Data Wrangling**  
Recognize each stage of the data wrangling process, encompassing gathering, assessing, and cleaning, by navigating through a concise walkthrough of the entire procedure.
* **Gathering Data**  
Collect data from diverse sources and an array of file formats using Python.
* **Assessing Data**  
Examine data for both quality and tidiness concerns through visual inspection and programmatically using pandas in Python.
* **Cleaning Data**  
Utilize pandas in Python to rectify the identified quality and tidiness issues during the data assessment phase.
